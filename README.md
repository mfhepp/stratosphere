# Stratosphere Probe

As a term project with Bachelor students, we are preparing the launch of a unmanned probe that shall be lifted to the stratosphere by a commercial weather balloon. The probe is based on a Raspberry Pi A+ and we aim at the following features:

* Continuous APRS transmission of position, system status, and sensor data
* SSTV image transmission
* HD video recording
